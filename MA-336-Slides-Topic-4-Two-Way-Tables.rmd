# Learning Goals

## Learning Goals for Two-way Tables

- Summarize and interpret the relationship between two two qualitative (categorical) variables using two-way tables.

- Demonstrate understanding and find conditional, joint and marginal probability from a two-way frequency table.

- Create and analyze two-way table to answer probability questions.

---

## Two-way Frequency Tables (1/2)

- As we organize and analyze data from two categorical variables, we make use of two-way tables.

- Information in a **two-way frequency table**:
  
  - Values of the two variables are displayed in the left column and the top row.
  
  - The body of table consists of frequency counts associated to pairs of values of the two variables.
  
  - The right column and the bottom row, which are called margins of the table, consists of row totals and column totals respectively.

---

## Two-way Frequency Tables (2/2)

- A number in a margin are called **marginal frequency** or **marginal distribution**.

- A numbers in the body of the table is called **joint frequency**.

- **Example:** Body Image and Gender.

|                   | About Right | Overweight | Underweight | Row Totals |

| Male          | 295             | 72             | 73              | 440            |
| Column Totals | 855             | 235            | 110             | 1,200          |

## Two-Way Relative Frequency Tables and Probability (1/4)

- A **two-way relative frequency table** is obtained from a two-way frequency table by converting  frequencies in a two-way table to relative frequencies.

- **Marginal probability**
  
$$P(X)=\frac{\text{Marginal frequency in}~ X}{\text{Total}}$$
- **Conditional probability**

$$P(X|Y)=\frac{\text{Joint frequency}}{\text{Marginal Frequency in}~Y} \quad \text{or}\quad P(Y|X)=\frac{\text{Joint frequency}}{\text{Marginal Frequency in}~X}$$
- **Joint probability**
  
$$P(X ~\text{and}~ Y)=\frac{\text{Joint frequency}}{\text{Total}}$$

- Note that $P(X~\text{and}~Y)=P(X)\cdot P(Y|X)=P(Y)\cdot P(X|Y).$

]

  - What proportion of the total number of students are male students?
$$P(\text{Male})=\dfrac{5802}{12000}\approx 0.4835=48.35\%.$$
---

## Two-Way Relative Frequency Tables and Probability (4/4)

- **Example:** (Continued)

  - If we select a male student at random, what is the probability that she is in the Health Sciences program?
  $$P(\text{Health Science}|\text{Male})=\dfrac{223}{5802}\approx 0.0384=3.84\%.$$
  - If we select a student at random, what is the probability that the student is both a male and in the Health Science program?
  $$P(\text{Male and Info Tech})=\dfrac{564}{12000}= 0.047=4.7\%.$$
  - The probabililies are related:
  

$$P(\text{Male and Info Tech})=\dfrac{564}{12000}=\dfrac{5802}{12000}\cdot \dfrac{564}{5802}=P(\text{Male})\cdot P(\text{Info Tech}|\text{Male}).$$

## Test of (No) Association (1/2)

- To understand association between categorical variables, we may think conversely. How do we test no association?

- If the conditional probabilities are nearly equal for all categories, there may be no association between the variables. Conversely, if the conditional probabilities are different enough, we are confidence to say there is an association.
  
- In general, the bigger the differences in the conditional probabilities, the stronger the association between the variables.

- Two variables $X$ and $Y$ are **independent** if $P(X~\text{and}~Y)=P(X)\cdot P(Y)$.

- **Example:** Is Body Image Related to Gender?
.center[
|                   | About Right | Overweight | Underweight | Row Totals |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Female        | 560             | 163            | 37              | 760            |
| Male          | 295             | 72             | 73              | 440            |
| Column Totals | 855             | 235            | 110             | 1,200          |
]

---

## Test of (No) Association (2/2)

- **Solution:**
  - Using Excel (stacked bar chart), we may compare side-by-side the conditional body image distributions for females and males
.center[
  ![resize: Stacked Bar Chart for Gender and Body Images, 90%](Figures/Gender-Body.png)
]

  - As a result of our analysis, we know that the conditional distributions for males and females for body image are not the same. There is enough of a difference to believe that those two categorical variables are in fact related.

## Percentage Reduction of Risk

- When calculating the probability of a negative outcome, we often refer to the probability as a **risk**.

- In general, we are interested in determining how much a new treatment reduces the risk compared
to a reference risk

- The **percentage reduction of risk** is
  
 $$\text{percentage reduction of risk}=\frac{\text{new treatment risk}-\text{reference risk}}{\text{reference risk}}.$$

- **Example:** [Risk and the Physiciansâ€™ Health Study](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wmopen-concepts-statistics/chapter/two-way-tables-4-of-5/)
  
---

## Hypothetical Two-way Tables (1/2)

- A **hypothetical two-way table** can be used to answer complex probability questions.
  
- **Example:** A pregnant woman often opts to have an ultrasound to predict the gender of her baby.
Assume the following facts are known:
  - Fact 1: 48% of the babies born are female.
  - Fact 2: The proportion of girls correctly
    identified is 9 out of 10.
  - Fact 3: The proportion of boys correctly identified is 3 out of 4.

  **Question 1:** If the examination predicts a girl, how likely the baby will be a girl?
  
  **Question 2:** If the examination predicts a boy, how likely the baby will be a boy?

- **Solution:** Assume that we have ultrasound predictions for 1,000 random babies.
  - Fact 1 means that $P(\text{Born as Female})=48\%$. 
  - Fact 2 means that $P(\text{Predicted as female}|\text{Born as female})=9/10$. 
  - Fact 3 means that $P(\text{Predicted as male}|\text{Born as male})=3/4$

---

## Hypothetical Two-way Tables (2/2)

- **Solution:** (continued)   
  Using those facts, we may create a two-way frequency table.
.center[
|                 | Girl           | Boy             | Row Totals  |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| Predict   Girl  | 0.90(480)= 432 | 0.25(520) = 130 | 432+130=562 |
| Predict   Boy   | 480-432=48     | 520-130=390     | 48+390=438  |
| Column   Totals | 480            | 1000-480=520    | 1,000       |
]

  - If the examination predicts a girl, the probability that the baby will be a girl is
  $$P(\text{girl}|\text{predict girl})=\frac{432}{562} \approx 0.769=76.9\%.$$

  - If the examination predicts a boy, the probability that the baby will be a boy is
  $$P(\text{boy} | \text{predict boy}) = \frac{390}{438} \approx 0.890=89\%.$$
